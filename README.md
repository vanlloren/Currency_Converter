This project is a simple implementation of a currency conversion tool. The first version is able to convert 10 different currencies (USD, EUR, GBP, RUB, JPY, CHF, CNY, ARS, BRL, INR)
using fixed conversion rates found online (last update 14/03/2024).

Later versions will hopefully include a fully automatized mechanism of updates directly from trusted sources on the internet to grant real-time conversion rates at all times 
and the implementation of a GUI substituting the textual interface.
